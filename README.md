## Exploratory Data Analysis and Regression Model on IMDB Movie Data

### What is Exploratory Data Analysis?
---------------------------------------
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a step in the Data Analysis Process, 
where a number of techniques are used to better understand a given dataset.

This involves but is not limited to:

* Identifying any outliers or missing values
* Identifying and extracting important variables
* Understanding the relationship(s) between variables
* Providing valuable insights relating to the data

### My Project
-----------------
In this [notebook](https://github.com/tadepoju/python-ldn-underground-eda/blob/readme-edits/London%20Underground%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb) the data I used relates to IMDB Movie Data data to summarise the key characteristics of the dataset 
and to produce a regression model to predict the Gross for a film based on 
specific predictor variables.


Dataset is from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows)
