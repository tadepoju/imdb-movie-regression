## Exploratory Data Analysis of London Underground Exit Data

### What is Exploratory Data Analysis?
---------------------------------------
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a step in the Data Analysis Process, 
where a number of techniques are used to better understand a given dataset.

This involves but is not limited to:

* Identifying any outliers or missing values
* Identifying and extracting important variables
* Understanding the relationship(s) between variables
* Providing valuable insights relating to the data

### My Project
-----------------
In this [notebook](https://github.com/tadepoju/python-ldn-underground-eda/blob/readme-edits/London%20Underground%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb) the data I used relates to London Undergound exit data to summarise the key characteristics of the dataset 
and to evaluate any patterns and / or a relationship between Morning and Evening travel peak periods.


| Period          | Hours Included | 
|:--------------- |:---------------- | 
|  Early          | H05, H06  | 
| ***AMPeak***     | ***H07, H08, H09*** | 
|  Interpeak      | H10, H11, H12, H13, H14, H15 | 
|  ***PMPeak***     | ***H16, H17, H18*** | 
|  Evening        | H19, H20, H21 | 
|  Late           | H22, H23, H00, H01 | 

### Required Libraries
------------------------
In this notebook I have conducted my analysis using a few
popular **Python** libraries:
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Statsmodels

### Data
----------
The dataset used can be found [here](https://github.com/tadepoju/python-ldn-underground-eda/blob/readme-edits/hourlyExits.csv) for those that are interested you 
can conduct similar analysis using the London Undeground Entry data [here](https://github.com/tadepoju/python-ldn-underground-eda/blob/readme-edits/hourlyEntries.csv).
